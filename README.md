# TSMOM-Strategy
Replication of TSMOM strategy proposed by Moskowitz et al (2012)

In the paper, the findings are as the following:
1. Strong positive predictability from a security's own past returns for almost five dozen diverse futures and forward contracts
2. Past 12-month exess return of each instrument is positive predictor of its future return
3. The time series momemtum or "trend" persists about an year and then reverses over longer term horizon

In TSMOM Strategy.ipynb, we replicate what has been explored in the above-mentioned paper to understand the key findings.
